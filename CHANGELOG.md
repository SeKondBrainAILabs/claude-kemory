## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-31

Initial release. Claude Code only.

### Added
- Bundled MCP server uses the hosted HTTP endpoint with `KEMORY_API_KEY`, so
  no CLI or local process is needed.
- 17 behavioural tests driving the real hook scripts, run by CI.
- `/kemory:status` slash command reporting credential, API, capture, and
  context-injection state, so users can tell whether the plugin is working.
- Client-side capture de-duplication: identical session digests are written
  once per session, since `SessionEnd` fires on exit, `/clear`, and resume.
- `SessionStart` hook that injects your Kemory namespace summaries into a new
  session, with a context budget, a namespace allowlist, and a once-a-day
  setup notice when Kemory is not configured yet.
- Shared credential resolver (`scripts/lib.sh`) supporting hosted bearer
  tokens and community-edition `X-API-Key`.
- `PostToolUse` hook reminding the agent to rate memories it actually used
  after a Kemory recall.
- `PreCompact` hook reminding the agent to consolidate before context is
  summarised away.
- `SessionEnd` hook that captures a bounded, redacted session digest
  (**opt-in**, off unless `KEMORY_AUTO_CAPTURE=1`).
- Hooks refuse to send credentials to a non-HTTP(S) URL.
- The rate reminder stays silent when a recall returned no memories.
- `kemory` skill covering recall, rating, storing, and phrasing memories so
  semantic search can find them again.
- Bundled stdio MCP server entry for the Kemory CLI.
