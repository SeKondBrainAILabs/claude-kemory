"""Assert the shape of the plugin's bundled MCP entry.

`plugin/.mcp.json` decides whether a user gets any memory tools. Nothing else
in this repo looks at it: on 2026-09-12 replacing it with a bogus endpoint and
an empty headers block passed all 85 tests, so a change that breaks every
install would go green through CI and fail only on the user's machine.

THE INVARIANT, and why it is worth a guard rather than a convention. The entry
has been rewritten three times — stdio, HTTP, stdio, HTTP — and each rewrite
fixed one population by breaking another, because a *static* entry can name
only one of the three ways a user reaches Kemory. stdio-to-the-CLI is dead
without the binary; an `X-API-Key: ${KEMORY_API_KEY}` header is dead for the
CLI and connector users who never set that variable, and it makes Claude Code
send an empty header, get a 401 and fall into an OAuth prompt for a server the
user never chose. So:

    one entry, launched through a script, credential resolved at launch,
    never a static credential in this file

What is checked:

  * valid JSON, one server named `kemory` — a typo here removes the tools
  * launched via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/mcp.sh`, which exists and is
    executable — the plugin root variable is the only portable path
  * no `type`/`url` — an http entry cannot resolve a credential at launch
  * NO credential anywhere in the entry: no headers block, no `KEMORY_API_KEY`
    reference, no literal key. A reference reintroduces the 401/OAuth failure;
    a literal would be a committed secret
  * `mcp.sh` sources `lib.sh` and calls `kemory_resolve_auth` — the point of
    the launcher is that the tools authenticate exactly like the hooks, and a
    launcher that resolved its own way would drift
  * `mcp_bridge.py` hardcodes no host — it must take `KEMORY_BASE_URL` from
    that same resolution, or self-hosted users lose the one variable that
    repoints the whole plugin

Prints a one-line summary and exits 0, or the reason and exits 1.
