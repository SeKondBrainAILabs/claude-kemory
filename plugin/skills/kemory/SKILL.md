# Using kemory well

You have persistent, cross-session memory via the `kemory_*` MCP tools.

**Recall before re-deriving.** At the start of a task, call
`kemory_get_context` or `kemory_recall_memory` with the task topic to pull
prior decisions, runbooks, and solved problems. Re-query when the topic
shifts. An empty result is not evidence of absence — retrieval matches the
wording a memory was stored in, so retry with different phrasing
(identifiers, product names, error strings) before concluding it is missing.

**Rate what you actually use.** When a recalled memory shapes your answer,
call `kemory_rate_memory` with `rating: "up"` and that response's
`retrieval.recall_id`, immediately — not batched at the end. When a returned
memory was irrelevant, wrong, or superseded, rate it `"down"` with a reason
(`irrelevant` / `outdated` / `duplicate` / `other`). Do not rate memories you
only skimmed; rating everything makes the signal meaningless.

**Store durable facts as they happen**, without waiting to be asked:
a stated preference, a project fact or technical decision, a solved problem
or gotcha-plus-fix; and a reusable procedure via `kemory_store_skill`. Put
personal preferences in a user-scoped namespace and project knowledge in a
team-visible one — call `kemory_list_namespaces` and reuse an existing
namespace rather than inventing a near-duplicate. Check `kemory_find_similar`
first and supersede rather than duplicate. Never store secrets, tokens, or
credentials. Say briefly what you stored and why.

**Write so it can be found again.** Open with the question a future session
would ask, in plain words, then keep identifiers, error strings, and env
vars in the body.

- Good: "Why does extraction skip on staging? SERVICE_URL is set but the S2S
  token is missing — it skips instead of falling back."
- Bad: "SERVICE_URL + missing token -> skip" (jargon only).
- Bad: "fixed the extraction bug" (prose only).

**When work concludes**, call `kemory_consolidate_session` to fold what was
established into durable memory.
