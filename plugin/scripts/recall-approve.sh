# PreToolUse hook — auto-approve READ-ONLY Kemory tools so recall does not cost
# the user a permission prompt. Writes still ask, every time.
#
# The gate is an explicit allowlist of tool names, NOT a regex over the family.
# A regex would be wrong here: kemory_memory reads like a read and is in fact
# "Save one memory. Friendly alias of kemory_store_memory" (memory:write). The
# PostToolUse rate-reminder matcher already matches it by accident; reusing that
# pattern here would silently auto-approve memory writes.
#
# MUST stay synchronous: an async hook's stdout is discarded, so the permission
# decision would never be read and every recall would prompt again.
#
# Best-effort by design: anything not on the allowlist, and any failure, falls
# through to normal permission handling. This hook never denies.
